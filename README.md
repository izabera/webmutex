% WebMutex API description

## API

Parameters can be passed as json in the body of the request,
or as http form parameters.

All requests also accept the mutex id via `/request/<id>/`

---

### Reserve a mutex: `/reserve`

Allocates a new mutex.

Parameters: (none)

Returns:

- `id`
- `status`

`POST` only

---

### Grab an existing mutex: `/grab`

Tries to grab an existing mutex if it's currently free.

Parameters:

- `id`

Returns:

- `id`
- `token`
- `status`

`POST` only

---

### Release a mutex: `/release`

Releases the mutex, using the token received from `/grab`.

Parameters:

- `id`
- `token`

Returns:

- `status`

`POST` only

---

### Checks mutex status: `/status`

Checks the current status of the mutex.

Parameters:

- `id`

Returns:

- `status`
- `in_use`

`GET` and `POST`

---

### Grabs as soon as possible: `/subscribe_and_grab` (**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**)

Contacts the endpoint when the mutex has been grabbed.

Multiple users can subscribe to the same mutex.
As soon as the mutex is available, one will be woken up.

Parameters:

- `id`
- `endpoint`

Returns:

- `status`

`POST` only

## Example use

Multiple tests in your CI are running concurrently.  You want to save their
results in some database but you can't be arsed to set one up properly, so you
figure you'll just use a sqlite file and sync it to artifactory, as sqlite can
sort the concurrency aspect out for you.

You proceed to naively wrap each test in

```sh
curl -O $artifactory_url/test_results.db
./build/mytest > test_results.json
./test_result_extractor test_results.json test_results.db
curl -X PUT $artifactory_url --data-binary @test_results.db
```

Now you realise that each test is running on its own instance of your CI, so
they're all grabbing the db and using their own local copy.  There is no
concurrency aspect, and when things get pushed to artifactory they overwrite
each other.  You screwed up, _again_, like you always do.  This is why nobody
loves you.

But you figure that not all hope is lost.  You reach this service.  Now you
just need to grab a mutex before fetching your db.

```sh
# reserve a new mutex (only needs to be done once)
curl -X POST https://webmutex.io/reserve > mutex
mutex=$(jq .id < mutex)

# run each test, protect any db updates using the mutex
./build/mytest > test_results.json

while ! curl -f -X POST https://webmutex.io/grab -F "id=$mutex" >mymutex; do
    sleep 1 # either loop like this or subscribe to the mutex
done

token=$(jq .token < mymutex)

curl -O $artifactory_url/test_results.db
./test_result_extractor test_results.json test_results.db
curl -X PUT $artifactory_url --data-binary @test_results.db

curl -X POST https://webmutex.io/release -F "id=$mutex" -F "token=$token"
```
